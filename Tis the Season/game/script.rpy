    kane "You'd better not be anything for Christmas, Holly."

    "My boss and fiancé, Kane. He's nice, but a bit of a Scrooge!"

    holly "Hi, babe!"

    kane "Don't forget about the important meeting in the big city. We're closing an expensive deal."

    holly "I can't believe we're having a big meeting so close to Christmas. Flights are so expensive!"

    kane "I don't make the rules, Holly. If flights are so expensive you can just drive."

    holly "I'm Holly."
    "We look at each other for a moment."
    holly "How did you know I'm from out of town?"
    nick "It's a small town. I know everyone here. Everyone."
    "I wonder if he knew my mother?"
    holly "Well, do you know where I can get a coffee? I've been driving for a while."
    nick "There's a shop called (shop name) just north of here on the left."
    "he points north for emphasis."
    holly "Well, thanks for the help."
    "That was SO awkward!"

    #put like a fadeout here

    "I got a hot chocolate - tis the season after all. It tastes delicious."
    "I'm walking around enjoying the sights. I haven't been here in over ten years. It's familiar yet strange."
    "I'm enjoying the walk until someone smashes into me. My hot chocolate spills everywhere."
    jack "Hey! Look where you're going!"
    "he takes off his hot chocolate covered coat and shoves it into my face."
    #show jack
    jack "this coat is dry clean only! Do you knwow what you've done?"
    "Now that I get a good look at him, he's quite handsome."
    holly "You were the one who running!"
    jack "Well you should have moved! I have a train to catch."
    "he storms off."
    "I can't believe I'm this clumsy! I've done this twice today already."
